## project description
---------------------------

During November 2020, Cpl Higginbotham from 1st Bn 12th Marines,
developed a console program that generates standard Suppression of Enemy Air Defense
(SEAD) timelines for artillery units, given Time Of Flight, Time On Target, and type of
marking round. The program was written in C++ using Visual Studio 2019.

SEADs are a fundamental component of modern indirect fire, however current software for
fire support (e.g. AFATDS, CENTAUR) do not have an option to generate a timeline. I believe
that this program would be extremely useful to Fire Support Coordination Centers (FSCCs)
and FiSTs (Fire Support Teams) to save precious time calculating timelines, while also
reducing the possibility of human error. Even in Fire Direction Centers (FDC) it would
constitute a valuable safety check.
